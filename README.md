### Introduction
<p align="justify">
  The "Request Management System" application was developed to electronically manage requests from the supply warehouse by departments within a healthcare institution . Users log in to the application with their assigned username and password and perform transactions with the authorizations appropriate to their role within the application.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  For example, while ordinary users can only request materials on behalf of their assigned department when they log in to the system, a user with request evaluation authority can review requests submitted by departments and, taking into account the inventory status of the materials, approve the request to be fulfilled from the warehouse, decide whether a portion of the request can be fulfilled from the warehouse and the remainder through purchasing, or reject the request entirely. A user with a purchasing role processes purchase orders received from the request evaluation unit.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Since the user in the Admin role has all the authorizations, he/she can monitor the transactions of all units or perform unit operations.
</p>

  Below are a few videos from the app, showing a user from each authorization group performing the actions. These will help you get a preview for the app.
